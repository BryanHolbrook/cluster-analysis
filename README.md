# Cluster Analysis
A program that analyzes clusters of 1's in binary text files in a regular N x M sized grid.

In Summary
* Functionality: The code reads a grid from a file, where the grid is composed of '1's and '0's. It then counts how many connected shapes (clusters of '1's) exist in the grid using DFS.

* Usage: This could be used for problems like counting islands in a 2D grid, connected components in graphs, or any scenario where you need to identify and count clusters in a matrix.
